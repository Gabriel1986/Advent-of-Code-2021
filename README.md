# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

Wrote some solutions for Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2021) in F#.
Most turned out pretty ok'ish, aside from the Day 15 Part 2 solution, which is just pretty darn slow...

## Run the code

Install .net 6.0, then in a console:

```
dotnet run
```

Additional parameters for dotnet run:

`all` - Runs all of the solutions

`<day>` - Runs the solutions for a specific day

`<day> <part>` - Runs the solution for a specific part of a specific day
