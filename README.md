# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

Wrote some solutions for Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2021) in F#.
Most turned out pretty ok'ish, aside from the Day 15 Part 2 solution, which is just pretty darn slow...

## Run the code

In a console, pick an option:

```
dotnet run
dotnet run all
dotnet run <day>
dotnet run <day> <part>
```
