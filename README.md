# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

Wrote some solutions for Advent of Code 2021 (https://adventofcode.com/2021) in F#.
Most turned out pretty ok'ish, aside from the Day 15 Part 2 solution, which is just pretty darn slow...

## Run the code

Install .net 6.0, then in a console:

```
dotnet run -- runs the latest solution
dotnet run all -- runs all of the solutions
dotnet run <day> -- runs a solution for a specific day
dotnet run <day> <part> -- runs a solution for a specific day and part
```
